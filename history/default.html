  <h2> [HISTORY] </h2>
  <div class="container">
  <h3>First Empire:</h3>
  <p class="center">History in the realm goes back to the first empire of the realm. Not much is known about the first empire, only that they were vast and magically adept. Various magical artifacts originate from the time of the first empire and tend to be some of the most powerful artifacts. Rumor also suggests that the first empire got most of its power through sealed genies. A magic council ruled the empire, but also brought them down. It is only known that differences in the council caused a massive split from the empire resulting in many different factions. These factions then proceeded to collapse under unknown circumstances, most believe it was the cost of their magic.
  </p>
  <h3>Rising Kingdoms:</h3>
  <p class="center">After the end of the dark era, new kingdoms came to be, and with them rich history.
  
<b>Imperium, Capitol Manne, Red Sun standard:</b> Often called the direct successor of the first empire, the Imperium is built much the same. Governed by a council and a lead emperor, this kingdom has seen some of the brightest days out of all the other kingdoms. Their capitol is also the same capitol as the first empire, and have hold over majority of the old magical artifacts used. Many speculate that they have acquired some of the genies in legend to grow their power, but this is not confirmed.
The current emperor Tiberius III is known as an aggressive and wild ruler. Often pushing the council to war to gain new territory, as he did with the now conquered Kingdom of Tironde in the northern region of the realm. His lust for conquest has not stopped here as he sets his sights on Hargonde...

<b>Hargonde, Capitol Haiwick, 3 Purple Griffons standard:</b> The most honor bound kingdom, Hargonde is ruled by a singular monarch. Hargonde was the first nation to create and use the crossbow as one of their primary ranged weapons for their soldiers. They always have prided themselves on their technological advancements that put them steps ahead of their opponents.
The current monarch, King Dontair Hargonde, is known as a kind and reasonable king. Many have placed him as one of the greatest strategists in the world, until his fault on the island of Palmara, which was recently taken by the Talgarians. As such, they are currently at war against them, and have an alliance with the Dun.

<b>Solus, Capitol Darne, 3 Horizontal Wavy Lines Standard:</b> While the Imperium is home of many of the original artifacts, Solus is home of some of the greatest accomplished sorcerors alive. The Great Library is also located here, where many of the realms wizards and sorcerors study. Solus is known as the home of magic, and most everything there is magic based. The capitol city of Darne is magically imbued to always be sunny.
The High Wizard, Aldric Solanus, is rumored to be immortal through magic, as he has been the ruler of Solus since its creation. Although very elderly looking, Aldric has gained such a following in Solus that some believe him to be a deity. Solus is also the most neutral of all the kingdoms in the realm, sticking to improving their magic rather than conquest. Not to mention that many kings don't want a thousand curses on their bloodline trying to invade.

<b>Dun, Capitol Craze, Flaming Axe Standard:</b> Dun is home to a lot of barbaric people. The people of Dun pride themselves on their strength and resilience. If a plague has swept across the Realm, rest assured knowing that the Duns have beaten this plague within a day through sheer will. They are also a relativly new Kingdom, cropping up as a sect from the Hargondians. The Dun share a lot of their honor, but nearly none of their intellectual prowess.
The King or Leader as they say, Raknok, is a barbarian at heart, and a leader only sometimes. The Duns do not carry any resentment towards other nations besides Solus, as they need to learn to live in the world and not study it. They also can't exactly comprehend what a curse is. Hargonde has resentment towards the Duns as they were originally Hargonians, but are too caught up in their war with the elves to do anything about it.

<b>Visegrad, Capitol Castle Visegrad, Black Thunderbolt Standard:</b> Visegrad is the most mysterious kingdom of them all. Recently rising to power, they were originally Imperium, but have grown to take everything south of the Darkhan River from the Imperium. The only thing people know about Visegrad is their extreme capability at night raids.
Duke Vulghar is only known by name and rumors of his magical powers are over exaggerated by peasents who fear that he might conquer the world.

<b>Talgaria, Capitol Thalorien, Light Purple Wheat Standard:</b> Elvish Kingdom. The Elves claim to be the original inhabitants of the Realm before the first empire was birthed, but there is no written evidence found to support this claim. It is true, however, that the elves used to be the primary race in the Realm, but as time grew on, the other races have pushed the elves out. As such, they have heavy resentment towards non-elves in Talgaria. (Not to say elves don't live outside Talgaria) As for the war with Hargonde, the elves got tired of the Hargonde slowly encroching on their territory, so they launched an offensive against the Island of Palmara, which is said to be the name of one of the first Elven mages. The conflict has been ongoing for the past year, and the elves are currently winning.
Queen Elara Aen Thae is the ruler of Talgaria, and arose to power with the intent of bringing the elven glory back to what it was at whatever cost. Palmara is not her last idea for conquest, as rumor has it that she plans on provoking Solus.

<b>Aeris, Capitol Dragon City, Black Dragon Skull Standard:</b> Aeris is known as the land of dragons. Due to the extreme mountainous nature of Aeris, many dragons used to live in this region. As of now, a dragon sighting is very rare and sought after for their treasure pile in their den. Even with mountainous terrain, Aeris prides itself on its vast farmland that can stretch up the mountain sides. The capitol city sits on top of a mountain that has been partially flattened on top that overlooks a large lake. Many have said it is truely a sight to behold.
Aeris is governed by a council of nobles, and their main interest is to keep to themselves. As such, they have defensive alliances with Talgaria, Edhen, and Dorwine (where they will aid in any invasion in exchange for food).

<b>Edhen, Capitol Zendar, Red Eagle Standard:</b> Edhen is one of the more poor kingdoms. They make most of their money through tariffs on the river that crosses through their nation, but due to the constant strife in leadership, the people never know who is really in charge. As such, the lands of Edhen are treacherous to travel through, as bandits constantly roam the main roads with nearly no opposition. The capitol city of Zendar is also in shambles. The castle is in a constant state of reconstruction and the city in shambles. Every new ruler brings instability into the guards, thus crime is very frequent.
The current ruler, King Thorin Ironfist, is an ego maniac and sets his sights on conquering other kingdoms. He just recently came onto the throne, and has no idea what he is in for...

<b>Dorwine, Capitol Crownspire, Black Sword Standard</b>: Dorwine is a rather successful kingdom. Their military might is known well throughout the south, as they have successful defended against multiple invasions from various kingdoms in the past, being Edhen and Avand. The capitol Crownspire is known as one of the largest cities in the south. The king's castle sits atop a large hill, and the spire in the middle resembles a crown, giving it the name Crownspire.
Dorwine has gone through some trouble, as King Valerius has passed, leaving Queen Aria Evendor the current ruler. The only child they had was a girl, Princess Calista, and are looking for a marrige partner that can help them retain power.

<b>Order of the Crimson Knight, Flat Red Standard:</b> The order is a insurgent group from Dorwine. The knights believe that the death of King Valerius was a biproduct of magic, and think that the court mage is responsible. As such, they banned all magic in their order, and hunt wizards in the area, believing them to all be schemers and plotting the downfall of Dorwine.
The leader was a knight in the Evendor's court. Only known as the Crimson Knight, he has proven to be quite powerful as he has felled great wizards and monsters alike. Some consider him a fanatic, others a visonary.

<b>Avand, Capitol Akalon, Yellow Chevron Standard:</b> Avand is known for its devout worship of the god Aeox, the god of fish. A prayer to Aeox means a good harvest of fish. As such, majority of their towns and villages border some form of water, as most of their economy revolves around fishing. In the center of Avand is a big marshland that makes habitation very difficult anyway. Currently, they are very unhappy with Dorwine and Edhen, as their lands are fertile for plants, and Edhen controls all their trade from the north through the Aldori River. As for Dorwine, its fertile land and a long standing beef with their kingdom. They are currently at war with Erias, which will be alluded on later. Their capitol Akalon is build in between the two rivers and is the biggest fish trading market in the realm.
The ruler, King Illandor Versatius, is an aggressive and arrogant ruler, and also extremely young following the death of King Omulous Versatius. He believes that the Realm is his to command and conquer as it is his birth right.

<b>Aldoria, Capitol Talon, Golden Eagle Standard:</b> Aldoria one of the wealthiest nations in the Realm, even though it wouldn't look it. Mainly populated by dwarves, Aldoria has an extensive mining network within their kingdom that continually produces raw materials that every kingdom needs. The people are hard working, honest folk, who live mainly underground. Talon, from the river, looks like a small fishing village, but once past the large stone gate, it is the largest underground city in the Realm.
Their ruler, King Kagruki, is a suprisingly tall dwarf, 4 inches taller than the average. Known for his money making mentality, he will put the mines over many other things, as they bring in the wealth.

<b>Erias, Capitol Gar, Half Blue and Half Black Standard:</b> Erias is very similar to Avand, but with one key difference. Erias is known for its devout worship of the god Aeon, also the god of fish. Erias is home to the largest off shore fishing ports in the Bay of Pors, and majority of their wealth from fish. Their war with Avand is very long standing, and is currently in a stalemate. Neither kingdom is made up of exceptional fighters, and their navy's consist of fishing boats. The conflict originates at the end of the First Empire, when the statue of the god of fish was presumed to be constructed. Most thing that the conflict started from two people misreading the name on the statue, but now is based on the idea that there is only one true fish god.
Gar is a large port city, which has a very large warf do dock the many fishing ships. The ruler, King Cod, is a fisher first, and king second. His queen usually runs internal affairs while he is out fishing. To other nations, they are very peaceful, but have extreme disdain towards anyone from or related to Avand.

<b>Marindale, Capitol Isenda, Twin Spear Standard:</b> Marindale is the biggest importer of foriegn goods from outside the Realm. Seen as the trade hub of the Realm, many exquisite items can be found here, as well as some expensive exports. Home to the largest navy in the Realm, Marindale also has strong control over majority of the ocean around the Realm. Or atleast they did until Visegrad took their second largest port, just west of Castle Visegrad. Not many like Marindale, but appreciate their importation efforts. They are currently at war with Visegrad, but have not made any ground into their territory.
The ruler, Regent Avax, isn't the most immersed king. Marindale has a council of nobles that have large amounts of land and wealth, and many presume that the Regent is just their puppet.

<b>Inand, Capitol ???:</b> Nothing is really known about Inand, and remains the realms largest mystery. Being the largest island in the Realm, many have tried to explore its lands, but none have returned. The north side is filled with fog and hideous creatures. Some ancient texts say that Inand is where some of the most dangerous magic prisoners were held, along with some of the most powerful magic items known to man. As such, many see the fog and monsters as a magic curse. Some explorers were determined to discover Inand's secrets, and sailed to the south and created a colony called Ino. For the first time, someone has set foot in Inand and came back to tell the tale, but exeditions further mainland have been halted until more supplies can be delivered.

Off of the mainland, many small island and island chains exist, but many not dare venture that far, lest they be raided by pirates and most definitely killed.</p>
