  <p class="center">Danny - After 8 years of doing basically nothing, just some small crimes for Money Josh, your master has a new goal for you. Tired of all the small robberies, he has something big planned and wants you to meet with his people in Dorwine's capitol, Crownspire. They will be at the royal banquet, where you will have an invite. Bring your best game, because things might get heated pretty quick...
 
Carson - tracking an animal led to dorwine capitol, slain a very nice boar, where some royal hunters found it and said that he should prepare it or something for the royal banquet, insisted heavily…
Carson - After hunting for survival, Lex's travels led her to a nice forest. Looking for her next meal, she started to track a boar. Once spotted, the boar was one of the finest boar's she has ever seen. Upon getting closer, signs of a struggle started to emerge.

Cullen - Sap was not very good with directions, so as he travelled to Solus, he went the complete opposite way and ended up in Dorwine. Even more confused, when he reached the capitol, he asked around for wizard lessons, to improve his connection to his dead mother and get better with spells. Some people gave him directions to a wizard spell shop, but again fumbled his way through town and ended up at the royal castle. Thinking wizards were over the top, he went in and found himself at the royal banquet.

Frank - While travelling, ran into group of traders and tried to barter. While bartering, bandits attacked, same as the ones from the village (or so it seemed). Barely making it through the fight, nimrod followed the last remaining raider as he fled. His trail led to a group of Dorwine nobles, and when the last bandit was defeated, the nobles invited him to the royal banquet in appreciation for his valiant efforts.

Jake - haunted by the guilt of his village, he vowed to get revenge on the humans. After a lengthy period of research and recon, he found that the humans that burnt his village resided in Dorwine. Once he traveled there, all he found was an empty house where they once were, and some royal guards outside. The guards claimed to have gotten rid of some squatters in the residence, but the group of people squatting were long gone now. As Soren explains that the humans burnt his village down, the guard feel remorse, and decide to get him some help on his quest. They have more information on the squatters, but the only person who can give that info is at the royal banquet, and will be out of the kingdom afterwards. So if he wants the info, he should go to the royal banquet, where the guards formally invite him.

Richard - Rumor has it that the Golden Hand is plotting something sinister within Dorwine. Dick travels there in an attempt to destroy the cult once and for all, or at least take a chunk off. Once in the capitol, he asks around about these cultists, and many are clueless, until one person says they have seen the cultists go in and out of a specific building. Upon entering said building, he finds it abandoned, with a pair of royal guards outside (SIMILAR TO JAKE). They say some squatters were inside and they apparently burnt this village down. Inside, Dick looks for any clues on their wherabouts, where in the rubble he finds a slip of parchment. All it says is “Tonight, the plans will be set in motion. Happy feasting… -J” Showing the paper to the guards, they say that the paper might be referring to the royal banquet tonight, where there will be a feast. Can’t be anything else, since the squatters were removed today. They recognize potential danger and give Dick an invitation to the Royal Banquet to find the Golden Hand and stop their plans.

Mike - While fishing, the fish told her about the capitol of Dorwine, and that the adventurers inside could lead her to some lost artifacts of Aeox. All that she knew was that the artifacts were being held by a cult, and that one of the artifacts would be at a royal banquet. In order to get an invite, Arda caught one of the greatest fish she had ever seen, and brought it to the Royal palace (back side) to try and get an invite. Luckily, they were short staffed, and asked if she could fill in for one of the servers.

Brownie - In a tavern, drinking your life away. Fuzzy memories of a drinking contest, an important figure, and a sense of victory. From there its a blank. You regain conciousness at a table, surrounded by men who could be described as brutes. Everyone around you is drinking, and one taste in the goblet next to you tells you that this mead is royal mead. As your vision grows less fuzzy, you realize you are sitting inside the royal palace at what seems to be a banquet, but you have no recollection why or how you are here...

Aidan - After leaving his family's house, Acorn's travels and ideals led him to uncover a cult called the Golden Hand. This cult preys on the weak and sews chaos and despair into those around them in order to please their "deity". Acorn is reminded of his brother, and when describing his incident to others seeking justice against the Golden Hand, they recognized his brother as one of the priests of the cult, his name was Nut. The other travelers and do-gooders also relayed the information they gathered to Acorn. The cult was rumored to have plans inside the capitol of Dorwine, Crownspire, where a Royal banquet was involved. Acorn's quest led him to Crownspire, where he requested an invite to the banquet, where he was swiftly denied. Explaining his mission and his goal, the guards outside heard about this cult and already let some others in on the same basis, so they reluctantly let him inside...
